## 📌 Overview
This script automates the process of generating a commit history. It allows you to fill in your GitHub contribution graph by creating commits for past dates, using realistic time-stamping (9 AM - 6 PM) and adjustable "intensity" levels to simulate a natural workflow.

## 🚀 Features
* **Backdated Commits:** Specify exactly how many days into the past you want to start.
* **Realistic Timing:** Randomizes commits within standard business hours (9 AM - 6 PM) to avoid "bot-like" 3:00 AM timestamps.
* **Intensity Control:** Choose the probability (0.1 to 1.0) of commits occurring on any given day.
* **Natural Variety:** Randomly generates 1–3 commits on active days for a varied, organic-looking heatmap.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone your target repository** (or create a new empty one on GitHub and clone it locally).
2. **Place the script** (`main.py`) in your repository folder.
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
